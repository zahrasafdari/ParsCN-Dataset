## Overview

**ParsCN** is the first large-scale, carefully curated Persian dataset for counter-narrative generation targeting online hate speech. It contains **1,100 hate speech–counter-narrative pairs** spanning six target groups and six countering strategies, tailored to the socio-cultural context of Persian online discourse.

The dataset was built through a novel **multi-stage pipeline** combining expert human annotation, strategic translation, and few-shot LLM-augmented generation — each step followed by rigorous human curation — making it a rich, balanced, and culturally grounded resource for both training and evaluating counter-narrative systems in a low-resource language setting.

---

## Key Features

- **1,100 HS–CN pairs** covering 6 target groups and 6 counter-narrative strategies
- **Multi-source construction**: native Persian hate speech (PHATE), translated and culturally adapted instances (MultiTarget-CONAN, HateXplain)
- **LLM-augmented generation**: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Qwen3-235B-A22B with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting
- **Thorough evaluation**: both human and automatic metrics (BERTScore, Perplexity, Distinct-n, Toxicity)
- **Baseline benchmarks**: mBART and PersianMind evaluated on a held-out test set
- **FAIR-compliant**: persistent DOI, CC BY 4.0 license, standard CSV format

### Dataset Fields (`ParsCN-Dataset.csv`)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `Hate_Speech` | Persian hate speech instance |
| `Counter_Narrative` | Corresponding Persian counter-narrative |
| `Target_Group` | One of: Religious, Racial, Gender, Political, Occupational, National |
| `Counter_Type` | One or more of the six counter-narrative types (see below) |
| `Annotator` | Source: Human, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Qwen, or MT-CONAN |

## Dataset Details

### Target Groups

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| Religious | Statements targeting religious groups (e.g., Islam, Judaism) |
| Racial | Speech discriminating against ethnic/racial groups (e.g., Azeris, Kurds) |
| Gender | Statements derogatory to men, women, or activists |
| Political | Expressions targeting government, politicians, or country laws |
| Occupational | Statements targeting professions (e.g., police, teachers) |
| National | Speech targeting national or immigrant groups (e.g., Afghans, Arabs) |

### Counter-Narrative Types

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Positive Response | Fosters empathy and inclusion |
| Counter Questions | Prompts reflection on biases |
| Denouncing | Rejects harmful rhetoric |
| Fact-based | Corrects misinformation with evidence |
| Warning of Consequences | Highlights negative outcomes |
| Contradiction | Exposes logical inconsistencies |

### Dataset Composition

| Source | Stage | Instances |
|---|---|---|
| PHATE (native Persian) | Stage 1 | 450 |
| MultiTarget-CONAN (translated) | Stage 1 | 150 |
| LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, Qwen) | Stage 2 | 500 |
| **Total** | | **1,100** |

## Dataset Creation Pipeline

The dataset was built in two stages:

**Stage 1 — Manual Annotation (600 pairs):** Three native Persian annotators with backgrounds in hate speech research wrote and curated counter-narratives for instances drawn from PHATE and translated examples from MultiTarget-CONAN. All pairs were annotated with target group and counter-narrative type labels.

**Stage 2 — LLM-Augmented Generation (500 pairs):** New hate speech instances were sourced from PHATE, MT-CONAN, and HateXplain. A `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` SentenceTransformer model retrieved the top-10 semantically similar Stage 1 pairs for each new instance, which were then used as few-shot examples to prompt four LLMs. All 500 generated counter-narratives were manually reviewed and curated before inclusion.

---

## Usage

### Load the Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('ParsCN-Dataset.csv')
print(df.head())
print(f"Total pairs: {len(df)}")
print(f"Target groups: {df['Target_Group'].unique()}")
```

### Run the Baseline Notebook

Open `baseline-eval.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab. The notebook is self-contained and walks through:

1. mBART fine-tuning on MT-CONAN data
2. PersianMind counter-narrative generation
3. Automatic evaluation (Perplexity, BERTScore, Distinct-n)
4. Toxicity evaluation using the Glot500 classifier
